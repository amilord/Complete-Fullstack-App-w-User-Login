Complete-Fullstack-App-w-User-Login

This project is a Mood board fullstack app. It lets the user dynamically add their daily moods using date, mood, and comment. The user is able to keep track of their entries and delete entries. This project was diffcult at first, but once It was broken down into pieces it was easy to digest. This was my first real application that used server-side databases to store data. Learning to understand and put together the code that would eventually allow a user account to be created proved to be pretty difficult at first, especially implementing user-based data logging.
